WIP

This is an agentic system, where you can prompt an LLM to do one of 3 things:

1. Predict the result of an NFL game between two arbitrary teams
2. Plot the trueskill ratings of any NFL team over the course of any given season
3. Get the stats for a given team in a given week of any season


Note: The team rating method is a quick & dirty solution. The primary goal was to create a decent solution quickly and without needing a lot of data (which is mostly not freely available). In other words, it's not intended to be the best solution.

TODO:
- Handle edge cases
- Evaluate LLM portions of the system
- Complete documentation
